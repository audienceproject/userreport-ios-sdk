## Requirements
- Xcode 9.0+
- iOS 9.0+

## Installation
The UserReport iOS SDK can be installed in various ways.

### CocoaPods
[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) is a centralized dependency manager for
Objective-C and Swift. Go [here](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/index.html)
to learn more.

1. Add the project to your [Podfile](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/the-podfile.html).

    ```ruby
    pod 'UserReport'
    ```
2. Run `pod install` and open the `.xcworkspace` file to launch Xcode.
3. Import the UserReport framework.

    ```swift
    import UserReport
    ```

### Manually
To install it manually drag the UserReport project into your app project in Xcode or add it as a git submodule.
In your project folder enter:
```bash
$ git submodule add git@github.com:AudienceProject/userreport-ios-sdk.git
```

## Usage for screen/section tracking
### Configure
Configure the UserReport iOS SDK using your `PUBLISHER_ID` and your `MEDIA_ID`.

Your `PUBLISHER_ID` and `MEDIA_ID` can be found on the Media Setting page in UserReport.

```swift
// Configure
UserReport.configure(sakId: "PUBLISHER_ID", mediaId: "MEDIA_ID")

```

### Screen tracking
#### Automatic tracking
If you want to automatically measure all screen views, your application's `ViewController`s  should inherit from the `UserReportViewController` class.

Example of automatic tracking:

```swift
class ViewController: UserReportViewController {
    ...
}
```

#### Manual tracking
There are two types of tracking:
  - Screen view tracking (`UserReport.trackScreenView()`)
  - Section view tracking (`UserReport.trackSectionScreenView()`)

If a media (website) has one single topic, it can be tracked using `UserReport.trackScreenView()`.

If a website has different sections, for instance *Health*, *World news* and *Local news*, then it should be tracked using both `UserReport.trackScreenView()` and `UserReport.trackSectionScreenView(sectionId)`.  The `sectionId` for a particular section can be found on the Media Setting page in UserReport.

Example of manual screen tracking:
```swift
class ViewController: UIViewController {
    override open func viewDidAppear(_ animated: Bool) {
        super.viewDidAppear(animated)

        // Tracking screen view
        UserReport.trackScreenView()
    }
}
```

Example of manual section tracking:
```swift
class ViewController: UIViewController {
    override open func viewDidAppear(_ animated: Bool) {
        super.viewDidAppear(animated)

        // Tracking section view (use both functions)
        UserReport.trackScreenView()
        UserReport.trackSectionScreenView(sectionId)
    }
}
```

#### Do not combine automatic and manual tracking
If you use the `UserReport.trackSectionScreenView` and/or `UserReport.trackScreenView()` methods, then automatic tracking should be disabled. As you can see in the manual tracking example, the `ViewController` does *not* inherit from `UserReportViewController`.

## Usage for surveying
### Configure
Configure the UserReport iOS SDK using your `SAK_ID`, your `MEDIA_ID` and information about the user.

Your `SAK_ID` and `MEDIA_ID` can be found on the Media Setting page in UserReport.

```swift
// Create user object (optional)
let user = UserReportUser()
user.email = "example@email.com"

// You can also specify a email hash
user.emailMd5 = "MD5_EMAIL_HASH"
user.emailSha1 = "SHA1_EMAIL_HASH"
user.emailSha256 = "SHA256_EMAIL_HASH"

// Provide additional social network information
user.facebookId = "FACEBOOK_ID"

//It is possible to override the default rules for when a survey will appear.
//However, the settings parameter is optional.
let settings = UserReportSettings()
settings.sessionScreensView = 5
settings.inviteAfterNSecondsInApp = 20

// Configure
UserReport.configure(sakId: "YOUR_SAK_ID", mediaId: "YOUR_MEDIA_ID", user: user, settings: settings)

```

### Display mode
The survey can appear in two ways:

- `.alert` - show survey like an alert view (Default)
- `.fullScreen` - show survey in full-screen mode, like the modal view controller

To change the display mode, please specify following:

```swift
UserReport.setDisplayMode(.fullscreen)
```

### Change settings
To update the default rules for appear the survey use follow:
Though, it is recommended to pass `UserReportSettings` to configure method instead, use this method only when you want to change rules for already launched app
```swift
let settings = UserReportSettings()
settings.sessionScreensView = 5
settings.inviteAfterNSecondsInApp = 20

UserReport.updateSettings(settings)
```

### Mute
For the survey not to appear on important screens, you can use a variable `mute`.

```swift
UserReport.mute = true
```
> Do not forget to restore value back to `false`.


### Update user info
When changing user data, you should also send the updated data to the UserReport iOS SDK.

```swift
let user = UserReportUser()
user.email = "new_example@email.com"

UserReport.updateUser(user)
```

### Session info
UserReport SDK stores the data on the count of screens viewed and the time the application is used. If necessary, you can get this data from a variable `session`. The session contains the following values:

- `screenView` - number of screens viewed in the current session
- `totalScreenView` - number of screens viewed in all session
- `sessionSeconds` - number of seconds spent in the application for current session
- `totalSecondsInApp` - number of seconds spent in the application for all time
- `localQuarantineDate` - date until the survey will not appear again
- `settings` - current settings for the survey appearance


```swift
// Session information about the running time of the application and screen views
let session = UserReport.session

// Get current settings for appear survey
let currentSetting = session?.settings
```

### Manually
If you decide to show the survey yourself, then you can use the following method:

```swift
UserReport.tryInvite()
```

### Anonymous tracking mode
If anonymous tracking is enabled: all requests will be fired to the do-not-track domain and AAID will never be sent.
To enable anonymous mode you can use following method:

```swift
UserReport.setAnonymousTracking(true)
```

### IDFA
The SDK relies on IDFAs, so make sure to mark the appropriate checkboxes when publishing your app.
